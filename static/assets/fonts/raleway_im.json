Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.","manufacturerURL":"http://theleagueofmoveabletype.com","designerURL":"http://pixelspread.com","licence":"This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
